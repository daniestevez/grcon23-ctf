# GNU Radio Conference 2023 Capture The Flag: DVB-S2 track

This repository contains all the files used to prepare the GRCon23 CTF track
about DVB-S2.

The repository is somewhat disorganized, but probably the best place to start is
the [Jupyter notebook](TS.ipynb) and
[this blog post](https://destevez.net/2023/09/dvb-s2-grcon23-ctf-challenge/).
