# VobSub index file, v7 (do not modify this line!)
#
# To repair desynchronization, you can insert gaps this way:
# (it usually happens after vob id changes)
#
#    delay: [sign]hh:mm:ss:ms
#
# Where:
#    [sign]: +, - (optional)
#    hh: hours (0 <= hh)
#    mm/ss: minutes/seconds (0 <= mm/ss <= 59)
#    ms: milliseconds (0 <= ms <= 999)
#
#    Note: You can't position a sub before the previous with a negative value.
#
# You can also modify timestamps or delete a few subs you don't like.
# Just make sure they stay in increasing order.
